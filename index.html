      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>My Name is Disney Harley, I currently live in Bronx, NY. I prefer to go by Dominic, however you can call me what you like.
        I am an aspiring web developer and designer. I began my journey when I was younger when I asked my mother
        for a cell phone and she gave me a windows phone. I was hoping for an iPhone but that didnt stop me from
        having a good phone. I then went and took the phone and put android on that phone. Although it was not apple
        I was completely satisfied. I had always taken a interest in computers and as I got older I picked up web development
        and coding. I plan to be a full stack web developer and a web designer. I also want to try to get into ui/ux design as well
        as having my own business selling websites and other services as well. I plan to go to school at General Assembly to further my
        knowledge and education on these topics. I have also already started to work on my business plan and things of that nature. My future
        and image are very important to me and i put 100% into everything that I do.</p>
